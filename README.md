## Repository Structure


0) Research Proposal / Outline - ***/proposal/***
    - Formulate a research question, identify key data source, and discuss identification

**Make sure to change all file and folder paths when running the code**

1) Data Extraction - ***Python*** - ***/data_collection/***
    - Transforming the data provided by OpenAlex to an analysable format.
    - Currenltly using "csv" files to store data.
    - Potentially transferring to MySQL AWS database in the future.
    - *It is strongly advised to use a cluster computer for extracting publication data from the OpenAlex database.*
2) Data Processing, Filtering - ***Stata & Python*** - ***/data_processing/***
    - Identify economics journals in the OpenAlex database.
    - Identify authors that have published in economics journals in the past.
    - Filter the publication database to economics authors
3) Build a Panel Database - ***Stata*** - ***/data_preparation/***
    - Develop a running measure of contribution
    - Identify cross-institution movements
4) Data Analysis - ***Stata*** - ***/data_analysis/***
    - Identify individual and institution effects

5) Presentations & Working Paper - ***/presentations-paper/***
